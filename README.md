VaporGCM is a simple, yet elegant, Swift library that allows you to send Android/iOS Push Notifications using HTTP protocol in Linux & macOS. Created for Vapor.
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably deliver messages at no cost.

## üîß Installation

A quick guide, step by step, about how to use this library.

### 1- Add VaporGCM to your project

Add the following dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.Package(url:"https://github.com/shial4/VaporGCM.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 2)
```

And then make sure to regenerate your xcode project. You can use `vapor xcode -y` command, if you have the Vapor toolbox installed.

## üöÄ Usage

### 1- Send Message

It's really easy to get started with the VaporGCM library! First you need to import the library, by adding this to the top of your Swift file:
```swift
import VaporGCM
```
The easiest way to setup VaporGCM is to create object for example in your `main.swift` file. Like this:
```swift
import Vapor
import VaporGCM

let drop = Droplet()
let gcm = VaporGCM(forDroplet: drop, serverKey: "bk3RNwTe3H0:CI2k_HHwgIpoDKCIZvvDMExUdFQ3P1...")
```
After you have the VaporGCM instance, we can go ahead and create notification object. To do that we need to use `GCMPayload`
```swift
let gcmPayload = GCMPayload()
```
Creating object is simple but it comes with multiple properties to configure:
1. title `title`
Indicates notification title. This field is not visible on iOS phones and tablets.
2. body `body`
Indicates notification body text.
3. icon `icon`
Indicates notification icon. Default value is set to `myicon` 
4. sound `sound`
Indicates a sound to play when the device receives the notification.
5. tag `tag`
Indicates whether each notification message results in a new entry on the notification center on . If not set, each request creates a new notification. If set, and a notification with the same tag is already being shown, the new notification replaces the existing one in notification center.
6. color `color`
Indicates color of the icon, expressed in #rrggbb format
7. clickAction `clickAction`
The action associated with a user click on the notification.
8. bodyLocKey `bodyLocKey`
Indicates the key to the body string for localization.
9. bodyLocArgs `bodyLocArgs`
Indicates the string value to replace format specifiers in body string for localization.
10. titleLocKey `titleLocKey`
Indicates the key to the title string for localization.
11. titleLocArgs `titleLocArgs`
Indicates the string value to replace format specifiers in title string for localization.


Despite of notification object we can add custom data to our message. To do that we will need Vapor `JSON` object 

After we've created the notification object it's time to actually send the push message.
```swift
let data = JSON([
"score":"5x1",
"time":"15:10"
])
```
We can now create message bject which is required to send notification to device
```swift
let message = PushMessage(gcmPayload: gcmPayload, data: data)
```
Message object do not require Notification or JSON object. We can as well send empty message.
```swift
let message = try? PushMessage()
```
We can create message just with notification peyload
```swift
let message = try? PushMessage(gcmPayload: gcmPayload)
```
Or just with data payload
```swift
let message = try? PushMessage(data: data)
```

Now we can send the message with notification payload and data payload to just one device, using:
```swift
let message = try! PushMessage(gcmPayload: gcmPayload, data: data)
let response = try? gcm.send(message, to: "bk3RNwTe3H0:CI2k_HHwgIpoDKCIZvvDMExUdFQ3P1...")
```
Sending message to device return Vapor `Response` object. Thanks to that we can interprate response by ourselfs and do futher steps.

VaporGCM allows us to send message to multiple device list at once by using: 

```swift
try! gcm.send(message, to: ["","",""], responseHandler: { (token, response, error) in
    guard error == nil else {
        print("Something wrong happen")
        return
    }
    guard response?.status.statusCode == 200 else {
        print("Error from server")
        return
    }
    print("Device token: \(token)")
})
```
Sending message to multiple device return response by `responseHandler` for each device received and identyfied by token.

Done!
To summarize
```swift
import Vapor
import VaporGCM

let drop = Droplet()
let gcm = VaporGCM(forDroplet: drop, serverKey: "bk3RNwTe3H0:CI2k_HHwgIpoDKCIZvvDMExUdFQ3P1...")

let gcmPayload = GCMPayload()
let data = JSON([
    "score":"5x1",
    "time":"15:10"
])

let message = try! PushMessage(gcmPayload: gcmPayload, data: data)
let response = try? gcm.send(message, to: "bk3RNwTe3H0:CI2k_HHwgIpoDKCIZvvDMExUdFQ3P1...")
try! gcm.send(message, to: ["","",""], responseHandler: { (token, response, error) in
    guard error == nil else {
        print("Something wrong happen")
        return
    }
    guard response?.status.statusCode == 200 else {
        print("Error from server")
        return
    }
    print("Device token: \(token)")
})
```

### 2- Device Group

Before sending messages to a device group, you must:
- Obtain registration tokens for each device you want to add to the group.
- Create the `notification_key`, which identifies the device group by mapping a particular group (typically a user) to all of the group's associated registration tokens. 

Basic management of device groups ‚Äî creating and removing groups, and adding or removing devices ‚Äî is performed via the:
```swift
let group = DeviceGroup(operation: .create,
                            name: "appUser-Chris",
                            registrationIds: ["4", "8", "15", "16", "23", "42"])
```
Where `DeviceGroupOperation` can be:
```swift
case create
case add
case remove
```

Sending Device Group Message.
This message will add devices with ids to exsisting group with name `appUser-Chris`
A successful request returns a `notificationKey`.
Save the `notificationKey` and the corresponding `name` to use in subsequent operations.

```swift
let group = DeviceGroup(operation: .add,
                                name: "appUser-Chris",
                                registrationIds: ["16", "9"])
        let response = try? gcm.sendDeviceGroup(group, forProject: "SENDER_ID")
        if let json = response?.json, response?.status.statusCode == 200 {
            let notificationKey: String = try! json.extract("notification_key")
            print(notificationKey)
        }
```

A successful request returns a `notification_key` inside `JSON`
Save the `notification_key` and the corresponding `name` to use in subsequent operations.
